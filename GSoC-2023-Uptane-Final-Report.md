# Project Abstract

Uptane is an important project that provides secure software updates for connected vehicles, and it needs to offer a better experience to its users to encourage the adoption of the technology. The project's website is the primary source of information for users and developers, and it's essential that the information is easy to access and understand. The current website has a lot of information. However, it's not well organized. It's difficult for new users to find the essential information they need. The navigation through the site is also challenging. All of these factors could discourage new users from adopting the system. The goal of this project is to overhaul the Uptane.io website to create a better user experience through more logical organization and easier navigation.
